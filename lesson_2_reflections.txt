What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

git init
Creates a .git file in the directory (an empty repo).Commits still req'd to save anything!  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area asks as an intermediary between your working directory and the repo.
git init
git add <specific files you want to add from your working directory).
