When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Remote repositories are key to enable collaboration. If multiple people are working on a project, they need a centralized repo
to work with. Remote repos also enable the developer to share their work (without exposing files/features that aren't ready to be
seen by the public!)
